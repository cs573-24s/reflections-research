Reflection: The paper investigates common pitfalls in graphical representations used in scientific publications. Data visualization combines art (visually appealing graphics) and science (accurate data representation), highlighting the challenges of accurate representation and the potential for misleading visuals. Incorrect visual representations can lead to wrong perception and decision-making. It examines common errors in visual representations, focusing on color, shape, size, and spatial orientation, using text mining and statistical analysis. The findings reveal the pie chart as the most misused graphic, with size being a critical issue, and significant differences in error proportions across visual elements. The paper intends to avoid common visualization pitfalls by providing a reference for practitioners.
