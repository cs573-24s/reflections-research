From Static to Interactive: Transforming Data Visualization to Improve Transparencyï¼šhttps://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002484

raditional scientific publications rely on static figures and tables, which may not sufficiently convey the nuances of data from studies with small sample sizes. This limits c
ritical evaluation and understanding of the results.he authors advocate for the adoption of interactive graphics in scientific publications. These dynamic visual tools can 
transform static reports into interactive datasets, allowing for more in-depth exploration and understanding of the empirical data.

This paper underscores a growing recognition in the scientific community of the need for more transparent and accessible data presentation methods. By showcasing the limitations 
of traditional static graphs and the benefits of interactive visualizations, it contributes to ongoing discussions about improving the quality and clarity of scientific 
communication.
