# **Methodology**

- LLM for visualizing multidimensional dataset through conversational interface. Authors conducts usablity studies with crowdsourced (40 participants) and experts (10 analysts). 

# **AI Thread**

- Chat bot is designed to handle conversation and retain it for context. 

# **Use Case**

- Authors used Military dataset on Kaggle from Armed Forces of Ukraine that tracks cumulative Russian losses in terms of personnel and equipment.  

# **Analysis from Experts**

- Authors state that experts emphasized the chatbot's role in streamlining exploratory data analysis and that more feature development should be done for complex data workflows.
