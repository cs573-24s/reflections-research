For this week I researched into one of the articles the professor linked for an IUI paper. 
I didn't know this going in, but this paper was in a relatively new state, not being completely finished.
Regardless, it still had a lot of cool stuff worth researching.
This paper researched into the effects of collaborative interactive education on machine teaching.
The main focus was to provide a website as means for students who wanted to tackle a machine learning problem the same way to collaborate and better understand what they're doing.
In terms of visualizations, a lot of machine learning based visualizations were done. For one, essential ones such as a confusion matrix and dataset images were automatically added for you.
The user is able to go through various images and get statistics about them, making this an interactive visualization.
While the paper didn't dirrectly test the efficency of the visualizations, they had garnered some results about the utility of the resources they provided. 
It's interesting to me to see how much visualizations can aid in the field of education, making it so there's less of a need for a teacher to be present.
