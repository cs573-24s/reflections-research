Since I am doing an ISG on this paper, I thought that it would be a good idea to summarize it in a weekly journal!

This study evaluates the effectiveness of two new map visualization techniques, Surprise metrics and Value Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUPs) in enhancing the interpretation of choropleth maps by users. A 300 participant crowdsourced experiment tested these techniques against traditional choropleth maps in map exploration and analysis. The findings revealed that Surprise maps directed users towards areas with significant population differences, while VSUPs were equally or more effective than choropleths in rate selection tasks. Participants often focused on only a subset of the metrics during their analysis. The results support incorporating Surprise and VSUP techniques into practice, indicating a positive direction for future development of map visualization tools. This experiment underlines the need for further investigation into how different data distributions and the designs of map visualizations impact user interpretation and decision-making. It also highlights the challenge of ensuring that users correctly interpret complex metrics like Surprise, suggesting a potential area for enhancing a user's data visualization literacy or map design.
