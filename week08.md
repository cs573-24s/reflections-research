Conceptual Metaphor and Graphical Convention Influence the Interpretation of Line Graphs
===

The study explored how we make sense of graphs and found that our natural way of thinking, like believing "up" means more or better, really does affect how well we understand graphs.
The researchers had a total of 600 people participate in their study to look at this.
They discovered that people get confused if you flip the usual way numbers go on a graph. For example, making high numbers appear at the bottom instead of the top. 
People were better at understanding graphs that showed good things, like more vacation days, compared to bad things, like more crimes. 
This suggests we're quicker at grasping positive news. 
Interestingly, when numbers were shown going from left to right, instead of from bottom to top, people found the graphs easier to understand.
This might be because it was a new and interesting way to present the information. 
The study suggests it's best to keep graphs simple and follow the usual ways of showing them so everyone can easily understand what they're looking at.
This is important because graphs are used a lot to share information, and making sure they are easy to understand helps everyone get the message clearly.
