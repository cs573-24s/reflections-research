Understanding Usersâ€™ Dissatisfaction with ChatGPT Responses: Types, Resolving Tactics, and the Effect of Knowledge Level
I found this study really interesting because it delves into the realm of user dissatisfaction with large language models (LLMs) through the lens of ChatGPT, examining both the nature of dissatisfaction and users' strategies for mitigating it. The research aims to address a gap in understanding how users cope with dissatisfaction arising from LLM responses, particularly in the context of chat-based interactions. Here's a breakdown of the key points highlighted in the study:

Understanding User Dissatisfaction: The research identifies seven categories of user dissatisfaction with LLMs, primarily focusing on instances where the model fails to comprehend user intentions. Accuracy emerges as the most significant factor contributing to dissatisfaction severity.

Data Collection and Analysis: A dataset comprising 511 dissatisfactory responses from 107 users, along with detailed accounts of their dissatisfaction experiences, was collected and made publicly available. Through analysis, the study sheds light on the prevalence and severity of user dissatisfaction.

User Coping Strategies: The study identifies four tactics that users employ to address dissatisfaction with LLM responses. However, it is noted that many users do not utilize any tactics, and even when they do, a significant portion of dissatisfaction remains unresolved.

Impact of User Knowledge: Users with limited understanding of LLMs are found to face higher levels of dissatisfaction, particularly concerning accuracy. Additionally, such users often exert minimal effort in addressing their dissatisfaction.

Design Implications: Based on the findings, the study proposes design implications aimed at minimizing user dissatisfaction and enhancing the usability of chat-based LLMs. These implications likely focus on improving model comprehension, providing clearer user guidance, and facilitating more effective user coping strategies.

In summary, the research contributes valuable insights into user dissatisfaction with chat-based LLMs, offering a nuanced understanding
