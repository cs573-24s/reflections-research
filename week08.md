The paper discusses the limitations of traditional static line graphs, particularly when used on small datasets or datasets with overlapping data points. According to the authors, 61% of papers contain at least one line graph, making this the second most common type of figure used to present continuous data.
The paper aims for the use of interactive line graphs, which can provide a better understanding of the data by allowing users to explore different aspects and layers of the dataset, such as viewing individual data points or comparing changes across different conditions or time points. The incorporation of interactive elements in data visualization can significantly enhance transparency and understanding, offering a more detailed and dynamic perspective on the data.
It argues that allowing users to interact with data provides a richer, more comprehensive view, helping to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpretation that static graphs may invite. Essentially, these interactive tools promote a more hands-on approach to data analysis, encouraging a deeper dive into the specifics and fostering a culture of transparency and critical evaluation in research.
