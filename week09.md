This week I chose the paper called "Investigating user behavior in slideshows and scrollytelling as narrative genres in medical visualization" by Sarah Mittenentzwei et al.

The goal of the paper is to determine what kind of method is better at converying medical concepts to a broader audience. I took interest in this article because my group is planning on doing our final project with scrollytelling. I am curious as to whether if using scrollytelling could provide a better experience in learning or focusing on the intended message. The experiment aims to determine which navigation method is easier, which resulting transitions are more pleasant and whether the amount of interaction is enjoyable. They had 3 types of setting provided. The first being a cerebral small vessel disease story that is implemented using PowerPoint; this design contains more realistic images and details with a navagation bar. The second being a BAV slideshow; it is made to have animations that mimics internal blood flow. These two follows a more traditional design. Then there is the scrollytelling-based naviagtion that recreates both stories that included videos and text as the user scrolls. One notable finding was that the navigation using the slideshow is more intuitive than scrolling. Also, the scrolling speed affected the user experience as well. This provides good insight for me when deisnging and creating the final project. The scrolling speed causing visualizations to not fall in place has happened to me before and defnitely influenced how long it took me to read the information. The lesson I took from reading this papaer is that scrollytelling is not necessarily better and we need to design it carefully for the best immersive expereience.
