This article, titled "Extending the Nested Model for User-Centric XAI: A Design Study on GNN-based Drug Repurposing", was my first foray into machine learning based visualizations.
The article specifically investigates the efficacy of AI-generated visualizations in explaining drug based topics according to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) standards, particularly in the domain of drug repurposing to evaluate the potential of drug predictions.
The makers performed a study consisting of participants that were data experts to test their model.
The model the authors created was DrugExplorer, which was a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, trained on a comprehensive knowledge graph.
It surprised me to see something like a GNN being used for this problem, but it makes sense for the types of visualizations they made.
They made different forms of visualizations, being path, subgraph, and node based ones.
The study had participants determine if a drug could be used to cure/aid with a particular disease to the participants, giving visualization based information.
The authors found the accuracy and confidence of participants at prediciton was high for path, and also had a low amount of time with it.
The participants of this study saw the value of this type of visualization, both in explaining info and generating new connections between drugs.
It's a wonder to see how AI can be so innovative in the visualization department.
