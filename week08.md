This week I reviewed the paper "Enthusiastic and Grounded, Avoidant and Cautious: Understanding Public Receptivity to Data and Visualizations" for my reflection. I saw this one in the inspo folder and was drawn in by the title. I think it is especially interesting and impactful because it doesn't really matter how good your visualization is if your intended audience is not receptive to it. In many applications such as writing and application design I have learned the importance of knowing your audience and keeping their needs in mind throughout the writing or design process, and that definitely holds true with data vis as well. The authors found through their interview study of 19 diverse participants that there is a need to consider information receptivity in addition to data engagement and data visualization literacy when designing for a particular audience. They found that the 19 participants all fell into one of four categories defining their information receptivity, those being Information-Avoidant, Data-Cautious, Data-Enthusiastic, and Domain-Grounded. 2 of the 19 fell into the "Information-Avoidant" category. They were resistant to consuming new energy information, regardless whether it was in the form of data or interpretations of data (such as visualizations). This aversion to information was not attributed to a disinterest in energy, as both individuals expressed interest in and concern for climate change. Instead it was found that despair and powerlessness were recurring themes in their interviews. For the other three categories it is true also that there are personal factors that play into someone's reception to data, and it is clear that this would also depend on the topic. The majority of the participants (11 out of 19) fell into the "Data-Cautious" category. There were common concerns of trust, bias, and agendas in this category. I think that this makes sense and it reflects the general sentiment of many groups in society today. We are taught to question the validity of the information we see online, and especially when something is unfamiliar or overwhelming, people may have a tendency to lean towards distrust. Only two participants were "Data-Enthusiastic" and both of them interact with data regularly in their professional work. Four participants were "Domain-Grounded" and they were all professional energy  analysts or energy domain experts. After highlighting the results of their interviews, the authors provide areas of future research that could be conducted to learn more about information receptivity. I think that the research done by the authors is incredibly interesting and has a lot of potential for uncovering methods for making data accessible even to Information-Avoidant people. While accessibility of visualizations is a frequently researched and discussed topic, I think that the accessibility goes beyond the visualization itself and extends to where the data comes from and how it is being manipulated. Transparency and honesty is clearly a factor in how some people approach new information, and by being more transparent about where data is coming from and what it can be used for may help some avoidant people warm up to new forms of data and visualizations.
