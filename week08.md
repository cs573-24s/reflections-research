Title: "Interactive Context-Preserving Color Highlighting for Multiclass Scatterplots"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05368.pdf

In this research paper Wang et al. argue for their context-preserving highlighting during the interactive exploration of multi-class scatterplots. Scatterplots are an extremely popular way to visualize the "distrubution of classes and the relationships among them" (Wang et al., 2023). When using multi-class scatterplots, it is important to take into account the colors being used and if they preserve or lose the context of the data. Currently, the Palettailor and Tableau palettes leave a lot of room for error when it comes to readability and creating a mind-map for the users. Whether the graph is static or interactive, the existing color-based highlighting causes the user to temporarily lose context of the overall picture and, therefore, lose their understanding of the data. The main of goal of this paper was to create a context-preserving color palatte to ensure quality perceptual separability for all classes visaulized and ensure further consistency. As a whole this method was broken down into three subparts: highlighty the selected data points to maximize the attention, maximize the visual discrimination between calasses, and maintain color consistnecy of data points when they are dynamically highlighted. 

To achieve their design requirement above, they first created two color mapping schemes Ps and Pf for salient and faint respectively to differentiate between when a data point is highlighted or not. To further, each salient color could not have too similar of a name to one another, however, the salient's faint color must have similar color names. While new methods are great, Wang et al. had to put thier new context-preserving method to the test by experimenting it in two seperate environments static and interactive against other coloring methods. These experiments were split into the following tasks: counting task, selecting task, highlighting task, and matching task to test the color palettes against one another. Overall, the context-preserving higlighting proved very dominant in the interactive data demonstrating its fantastic ability to distinguish its data from the rest. 

While color is oftentime overlooked and taken for granted in data visualizations it is imporant to understand its significance to the overall end-goal. Colors can confuse or miscontrue the user when not used correctly, however, when employed properly they can pull together large datasets and make them not only easier to read but very attractive.
