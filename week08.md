This paper describes the design of a community based conversational storytelling agent (CSA) that is used to document housing insecurity digitally, building off of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project. It analyses the benefits and risks of using digital automation in a grassroots project, and also contributes to debates on scaling storytelling practices with a focus on social justice. These conversational agents facilitate interaction with humans using natural language to mimic human-to-human interaction. It involved a prototype of a CSA for this purpose and 17 interviews with people narrating housing insecurity experiences and those who collect such stories, concluding that collectors see how multimedia and multi-language support can help with documentation. The experience was designed to be a multimedia storytelling experience, which is where the visualization comes in. Participants were able to choose a media format, and also saw the experience in a traditional chatbot form for comparison and exploring multimedia support on mobile devices. This involved audio, video and messaging. Participants were given a different experience from just a regular chat bot, which may affect how participants interact with it which is affected by the subject matter. The paper was also able to compare these for some purposes. It was concluded that it can be very beneficial for increasing interaction for storytelling, but also has risks of bias and a lack of personal connection.
