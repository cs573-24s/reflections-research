Visualization in Operations Management Research
===

In the field of operations management(OM), authors and reviwers often see researchers underutilize or incorrectly utilize visualization techniques that lead biased or incorrect interpretations.
This is because of The rapid advancements in technical capabilities and the expansion of available data have outpaced the development of comprehensive guidelines or standards for effective visualization in OM research.
Additionally, there is a scarcity of academic literature specifically focused on the role of visualization in enhancing the clarity and impact of research findings. 
This gap in knowledge and practice can lead to the misinterpretation of data, potentially resulting in biased or incorrect conclusions.
This paper address this gap by starting with an explanation of benefits of data visualizations in different stages (theory building, testing, translating results) in OM context.
Authors suggest that, beyond well-established data-to-visualization fit principles and guidelines, visualizations should also be evaluated agains other common metrics, such as efficiency, comprehension, memorability and engagement (I would also add "accessibility", after the presentation last week).
They also list some questions to be answered in visual renderings in the first stage of research cycles (e.g. "Does the visual clearly depict bounds on data and phenomena to facilitate the identification of unexplored theoretical phenomena?").
