The paper investigates the impact of metadata on understanding and transparency in visualizations through two experiments. The results suggest that visualizations with metadata are perceived as more thorough, but similarly accurate, clear, complete, and relevant compared to visualizations without metadata.

## Contributions
* Explored the relevance of different categories of metadata in communicative data visualization, based on participant preferences and goals.
* Investigated the impact of metadata on transparency, trustworthiness, persuasiveness, information relevance, and understanding of visualizations.
* **Found that visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough**, but similarly accurate, clear, complete, and relevant compared to visualizations without metadata.
* Discovered that the presence of metadata did not affect the accuracy of information extraction from visualizations, but it may have influenced participants' attention towards less obvious or emphasized aspects of the visualization.
* Identified that metadata may influence what participants remember as important or interesting in visualizations.

## Key findings
Some key findings:
* Participants in the experiments were most interested in metadata that explained the visualization's encoding for goals related to understanding and metadata about the source of the data for assessing trustworthiness.
* Visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough than those without metadata, but similarly relevant, accurate, clear, and complete.
* The presence of metadata did not impact the accuracy of the information extracted from visualizations, but it may have influenced which information participants remembered as important or interesting.
* The study also qualitatively evaluated what participants talked about when discussing visualizations with metadata, using an iterative method to develop a codebook for analysis.
* The results raise further questions about the potential role and impacts of metadata in visualization, encouraging further investigation in the visualization community.
