In the paper, three distinct types of sports data are analyzed: box-score data, tracking data, and meta-data. Box-score data adheres closely to the rules defining events within a sports event, typically visualized through rank charts where the y-axis denotes rank and the x-axis represents different variables. Over-plotting techniques are utilized to highlight record-breaking trends within the field, while relative differences, rather than absolute values, are often emphasized to provide deeper insights.

Tracking data, on the other hand, takes various forms and is constrained by the rules of the game, yet it has the potential to revolutionize how sports are perceived. For instance, in soccer, the concept of expected goals derived from tracking data has reshaped how scoring opportunities are evaluated. Event density maps offer a straightforward means of tracking player locations or attempts, applicable across multiple sports and scenarios. Moreover, adopting a first-person perspective through tracking data visualizations provides viewers with a real-time insight enhanced by statistical analysis.

Meta-data transcends mere contextual information, enabling the creation of entirely new visualizations that enhance understanding. By extracting characteristics of sports, players, and audience engagement, meta-data adds layers of context to the narrative. Predictive analytics, such as the plus-minus indicator, leverage meta-data to forecast team and player performances effectively. Additionally, the use of tree diagrams simplifies the representation of tournament brackets, aligning seamlessly with the flow of the bracket itself.

In the discussion, the authors describe the role visualizations play in sports. As a whole, visualizations are used in a narrative manner or an analytical use-case. Each case is shown throughout the data that is present and the way it is communicated. For example, narrative visualizations will quickly allow users to interpret different use cases and variables that cannot be conveyed easily by statistics.  

While this paper was interesting, it didn't serve like bowling alley bumpers like I thought it would have. In the end it showed me the open-ended nature of visualizations and how we are not confined to specific types of graphs. Rather, when creating visualizations it is more important to understand what you are trying to convey rather than "I want to use this graph" mentality.
