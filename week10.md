The paper I chose this week is from the inspo folder and titled: "Why Combining Text and Visualization Could Improve Bayesian Reasoning: A Cognitive Load Perspective". The goal of the paper is to suggest that using a combination of text and icon arrays, people experience less subjective workload when working on the problem and improves Bayesian reaonsing. The researchers set up the experiment with 3 different settings, one with icon-array, one with only test, and a combination of both. One of the major suggestion that came out of the paper is that using only icon or a combination of icon and text proves to be beneficial. For this portion of the paper, I think what I am understanding is that, when processing information and asked questions upon them, the amount of error that occurs depends on how it is presented. When the participants were tested, they found that the visualization with combined text and icon does not introduce additional cognitive workload. This to me means that it does not take the brain as much effort to process the current information. I believe that for a general purpose visualization, it is important to make sure that it does not take too long to understand the visualization and people don't make false interpretations. If the visualization causes strain on its audience, then it is not well designed. As the paper pointed out, Bayesian reasoning is crucial when it comes to designing general purpose visualizations, espeically for the medical field. This paper provides evidence suggesting that proper use of icon and text could be beneficial for a visualiation. When making the final project, since my goal is to have something educational, I would need to consider the result of this paper.
