This paper discusses how color concept associations are formed. It ran a study where the influence of input and cognitive factors on color concept associations was observed. Two experiments were conducted, each one consisting of one part where color-concept associations were introduced, with color not affecting accuracy, and the second part where the color-concept associations formed during the first part were assessed, along with other new "unseen" colors. Experiment 1 tested whether associations would be formed during exposure to images. The second seeked to replicate the effects from experiment 1 and test the asymmetric generalization hypothesis, which "suggests that patterns of colour-concept association generalization depend on colour typicality within the cognitive structure of colour categories". The study found that color concept associations formed were stronger as the co-occurence of a color and a concept was more frequent, with the effect being stronger when participants noticed color patterns while learning categories. It also found that the colors shown previously "seen" colors had stronger color-concept associations than new colors introduced during the second part of the experiment, "unseen" colors. This effect was stronger for those who didn't notice color related patterns than those who did. Altogether, this study showed how the study participants formed color-concept associations during these experiments. It found that such associations were formed differently depending on whether the participant noticed color related patterns.
