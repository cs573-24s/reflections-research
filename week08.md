This week I read the article "Hybrid design for sports data visualization using AI and big data analytics".
It focused on the implementation of a Video-based Effective Visualization Framework (VEVF) for analyzing and visualizing sports data.
The goal of VEVF is to enhance viewer experience and to provide teams and athletes with valuable insights about performance, technique, and and training.
The paper talks about the role that AI has played in the improvment of decision making through the use of CNNs in video classification.
The paper also explains the challenges involved in making complex multi-dimensional into visualizations that are easy to understand without a technical background.
The authors suggest that the future of sports data visualization will be interactive, real-time tools. 
Personally, I love the idea of being able to access and play around with live-sports player data.
I think it could be a really interesting way to give fans additional ways to interact with their favorite teams.
It could give diehard fans away to potentially find ways to improve their favorite teams and communicate with them.
It could also promote the pairing of educational tools with sports, allowing educators to appeal to children easier.
