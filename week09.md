In "Heuristics for Supporting Cooperative Dashboard Design" authors Setler, Correll, Satyanarayan, and Tory explore the evolving role of dashboards as interactive tools for analytic conversations. Their approach reframes dashboard design as facilitating cooperative analytical experiences, emphasizing interaction, and enhancing storytelling. The researchers introduced 39 heuristics aimed at promoting productive analytical conversations. These ideas were categorized into five distinct conversation stages: initiation, grounding, turn-taking, repair and refinement, and closure. To evaluate the utility and learning value of the heuristics when implemented, 52 master's participants were involved in a two part exericse: part A involved a reflective exercise, where participants would evaluate existing dashboards for coherence with the 39 designated heuristics; part B involved a redisigning exercise, where participants were gathered into teams to update or create dashboards using the same 39 heuristics. The results of this study was then able to relay the qualitative themes of both exercises' results to reevaluate the effectiveness of the heuristics.

Overall, I found this study's two part experiment to be particularly interesting. I think that observing the impact/efficacy of the heuristics by having participants evaluate existing dashboards and design/alter an existing one was a thorough way to investigate dashboard conversations. In this sense, researchers were able to see how participants percieved effective heuristics and how they ranked the importance of certain hueristics when in the design role. In the future, I think it would be potentially interesting to explore how implementing AI/machine learning algorithms might enhance the adaptability and intelligence of cooperative dashboards. These features could include personalized recommendations, automated insights generation, and predictive analytics, further enhancing the user experience and decision-making process.
