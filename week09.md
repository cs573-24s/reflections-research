The author proposes a technological perspective where the value of visualization is measured in terms of its effectiveness and efficiency.
It proposes an economic model to measure the value of visualization based on costs (development, user training, usage costs) and benefits (knowledge gained). THis is a simple economic model that includes various costs associated with the development and use of visualization tools (Ci, Cu, Cs, Ce) and contrasts these costs against the gains (G) from increased knowledge or insights derived from visualization.
The paper discusses implications of the model such as the subjectiveness of visualization, high initial user costs as a barrier to adoption, the role of interaction, and alternative analysis methods.
If considering visualization purely as a technology, the author concludes that there needs to be more focus on proving effectiveness, efficiency and adoption in real-world use cases by assessing costs vs. benefits rigorously.
The author suggests that visualization can also be viewed as an art form that has value in its own right through the elegance, beauty and intellectual satisfaction of developing novel visualization solutions.
