In this paper the researchers attempt to enhance the parallel coordinates plot. Parallel coordinates plots are very common plots for visualizing the relationship between dimensions of high dimensional data. In these plots each dimension is plotted as an axis, and the measures of a data point are connected across the neighboring axes. The researchers explain that since each point is plotted as a poly line across the entire plot, visualizing large amounts of data can lead to readability issues. They explain that while efforts have been made to include density plots to account for this, these plots can be hard to visualize on top of the data, and they do not account for categorizing the data set. In their paper they explore 3 ways of visualizing the denisty of the lines in a more effecient way that accoutns for classes. These plots include a stacked bar chart, multiple violin charts, and multiple box and whisker plots. These density plots can be color coded for different data point categorizations, and they plot them vertically on the dimension axes so that a viewer does not have to mentally map the density plot to the lines. They conclude that they charts can help a viewer more easily understand density plots with much more data. They also conclude that they prefferred the multi axis violin and box plots to the stacked bar chart as their ordering of classes could be more consistent, and stacked bar charts would become less readable as more classes are introduced. While I understand their reasoning, they don't consider that as more classes are used, multi axis violin or box plots will take up more space and cover up more of the parallel coordinates plot. They also don't consider how the distributions alone do not tell about the relationship, and I think more effort needed to be done to better show directionality of the lines for large data sets where lines will overlap and start to blur.
