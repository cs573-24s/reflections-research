X. “Bruce” Liu et al., “Visual Captions: Augmenting Verbal Communication with On-the-fly Visuals,” in Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Hamburg Germany: ACM, Apr. 2023, pp. 1–20. doi: 10.1145/3544548.3581566.

This is a paper about building and testing and AI program that accesses pictures that reference an ongoing conversation; hence, creating 'on the fly' visuals that can accentuate an ongoing conversation. I was actually really interested in this because I know people who use a lot of images, particularly memes or funny pictures, to accentuate their own conversations (usually text, but sometimes voice chat) in discord. Additionally, there have been instances where I'm having a conversation and want to google things, and having a picture readily available would make that much simpler. Looking at the specifics of the program and the experiment, I think their program could become a powerful tool for an app like discord, where the userbase is more attuned to using images to make their points. For instance, there is a subsection in discord currently that allows a user to pull up gifs, images, stickers, and emojis to use in their text messages, and I have seen this used in conjunction with actual conversations held over discord voice. An AI listener could monitor the discord audio and generate relevant images to it (although there is some privacy concern involved in this, likely the AI should only have access to your own speech and not that of others). I think a problem with this is having a generic AI deal with this: there should be customization and learning involved in the creation of this AI; as in, it should both learn from what the person is saying, and be able to be customized by the user with certain preferences. The other thing is, I'm not sure the exact contexts this could be "useful" in; while it will technically add to conversations, those conversations could have been fine the way they were. Additionally, if you want to do other things than talk, such as play a video game or take notes, having pictures is an unwelcome distraction and will be a completely unused part of the conversation.
