## Reflection
Research papers often have a tendency to be dry and dense, but this paper -- on the topic of a company transitioning to a PowerBI dashboard -- stayed readable and informative through the clever use of quotes and visualizations. Though the structure remained the same as a typical research paper, with an abstract, intro, related work, and analysis/results, the paper bloomed by describing their approach not only in words but also in pictures. The front page captivates immediately through the use of a visualization that shows rather than tells -- their study metalworking company is represented as a factory picture, and every observation noted is accompanied with a descriptive graphic of the task at hand. Each set of observations directly feeds into an "opportunity" section described further in a "research opportunities" portion of the paper.

The keystone feature of this paper for me is its "Figure 2" and "Table 1":

Admittedly, both visualizations are dense -- but they pop off the screen relative to any text, and they're far more informative than any research paper I've ever read. For the figure, I can tell immediately what the authors are doing and which authors are studying it through the use of color-coding and visualizations. For the table, I can quickly reference a participant's skill level and background knowledge, helping me understand just how each participant can contribute to the study in their own unique way.

The one note I may make is that participants are anonymized: although quotes are interspersed throughout the paper, we cannot tell which quote maps to which participant. This was an intentional choice to avoid identifying any one participant, but it certainly makes it more difficult to draw conclusions from experience level and background knowledge. 

All in all, however, this paper does an excellent job describing the challenges of transitioning to commerical dashboards with non-technical users -- not only through its use of interviews, but its descriptive and capitivating graphics. It is clear why this paper was accepted to VIS 2023.
