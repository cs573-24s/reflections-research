A Survey of Time Series Data Visualization Researchï¼š https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/782/2/022013/pdf

The paper mainly studies the visualization technology of time series data, including data analysis, mining, computer graphics, interaction design, etc. The paper first analyzes the characteristics of time series data, including time attributes and data attributes, and then summarizes two visualization methods: the visualization method of time attributes and the visualization method of high-dimensional time series data, and analyzes the visual interaction design method. Finally, the visualization of time series data is summarized and prospected.

Visualization methods for time attributes: including spiral chart, calendar view, theme river view, dynamic view, etc. These methods can demonstrate trends in data elements over time as well as periodicity in the data. Visualization methods for high-dimensional time series data: including thematic river views and parallel coordinate charts with timelines, etc. These methods aim to show how data states change over time and how each dimension changes over time.
