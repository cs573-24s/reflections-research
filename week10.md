This paper introduces a new approach to dashboard design by facilitating an analytical conversation, emphasizing user interaction and storytelling over statically displaying content. A set of 39 design heuristics, grounded in conversational flow principles, was developed to create cooperative dashboards that enhance user-data interactions. A study with 52 graduate students evaluated these heuristics, and applied them in critiquing and designing dashboards, revealing new insights into potential dashboard design flaws and encouraging more responsive design approaches. While dashboards generally support the initiation of user conversation well, they fall short in facilitating the quialities of turn-taking, repair, and refinement. This study highlights the need for future dashboard designs to better support the full spectrum of conversational engagement, suggesting directions for developing dashboard authoring tools that anticipate user interaction needs and extending cooperative principles to other analytical workflows. This research broadens the perspective on dashboard design, arguing that dashboard  are not merely for visual aesthetics, and to consider dashboards as interactive partners in analytical conversations. This paper creates new areas for enhancing the effectiveness and user-friendliness of dashboard tools.
