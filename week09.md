For this week's reflection I reviewed the paper: "Designing a medication timeline for patients and physicians" by Belden et al. Last week I read a paper that was related to data about energy use, so this week I wanted to look at a paper that looks at data vis for healthcare, since that is one of my other primary research interests. The authors' goal was to create a medication timeline visualization to help improve the ease of use and efficiency of ambulatory care of chronic diseases. In order to do this, the authors first identified the information needs for understanding patient medication history, and then researched existing lists and timelines and hosted design workshops to develop their initial concepts. They utilized interaction design principles and a user-centered design approach. I thought this was interesting because I recently utilized user-centered design principles for my MQP as my team was developing a prototype of an application for providing mental health care. It was important for us to use user-centered design because it is meant to be used to help people find mental health care, which can be vulnerable. I think a similar case applies for the work done in this paper, as the visualzation they are proposing is designed for use by emergency responders to learn quickly about a patients medical history to help them administer the appropriate care as quickly as possible. When an application is for something so important, it makes sense to use principles to ensure it is tailored to the intended user base as best as possible. Their final proposal is for an open-source online prototype. They explain that the prototype incorporates the feedback they received from users during their initial design workshops, in addition to feedback from a broad multidisciplinary audience. In their pilot evaluation, they found that use of their design showed improved physician performance in 5 common medication-related tasks when compared to tabular presentation.
