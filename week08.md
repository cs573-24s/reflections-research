In "Interactive Context-Preserving Color Highlighting for Multiclass Scatterplots" authors Lu, Reda, Deussen, and Wang explore their idea of **context-preserving highlighting** to effectively emphasize data points while preserving clear visual separation between groupings and general color mapping consistency. Recognizing that scatterplots are amongst the most used types of data visualizations, their pre-research identified that a major shortfall of most color schemes is their ineffectiveness when applied to interactive visualizations that require spotlight highlighting. This is best summarized in their wording: "existing color-based highlighting strategies cause a temporary loss of color coding, which disrupts exploration or, at minimum, the user's mental map" (Lu et al.). Thus, their research was motivated by finding a color palette that would support both "focus and context" for interactive (and static) scatterplots. 

To identify the optimal color palette, the team conducted two experiments. The first involved static visualizations and assessed participants' abilities to distinguish different classes via counting tasks. There were 4 conditional groups in this experiment and participants were asked to count the total number of different classes across 48 scatterplots. Results found that while Palettatailor garnered the best results, the group's method came in second, surpassing that of the two other Tableau conditions. For the second experiment, participants needed to complete three tasks with an interactive visualization: a highlighting task, a matching task, and a selecting task. In each of these, the group's method displayed significantly lower error rate in relativity to the other benchmark conditions. (These experiments were then followed by a series of case studies)

Overall, I found this experiment and overall concept to be especially interesting. Truthfully, I never really considered factors beyond the color-blindness spectrum and superficial differentiability when deciding on my graphical color palettes. Reading about how the team applied mathematical formulas to determine/measure features like approprate name differentials, background contrast, and point distinctness was very enlightening. Granted, I felt the paper could've included more diagrams/examples throughout the math section. I think because this paper was meant for people with more expertise, I found the math-to-color formulas a bit difficult to conceptualize.
