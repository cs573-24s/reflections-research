For this week I reviewed the paper "Anywhere & Everywhere: A Mobile, Immersive, and Ubiquitous Vision for Data Analytics" by Niklas Elmqvist. He introduces the idea of "Anywhere and Everywhere data" that comes from the constant collection and need for accessing data. Due to technological advances this new data presents new challenges but also opportunities for "data-driven sensemaking and decision-making that will require leveraging novel mobile, immersive, and ubiquitous technologies". The paper serves as a review of these new forms of analytics in an ecosystem of connected devices, interactive visualizations, and collaborating users. This paper was published in September of 2023, and some relevant new technologies have become available for commercial use in the time since this paper was published. Specifically the latest VR headset from Meta and Apple's first VR headset have become available. The author discusses the application of VR in creating a hybrid desktop/VR interface for analytics. They cite the different uses that each mode is best suited for, for example, the 3D VR setup is good for visualizing tracking and event logs over time, or looking at how two participants worked together in a 3D assembly task. However, the 2D desktop setup is better for deriving high-level abstract findings. It makes sense that not all tools are useful for the same tasks, and the author talks about how having access to these tools is not about using all of them all of the time, but being able to choose the right tools for the right situation. With the possibilities of conducting analysis on a wide variety of devices comes the need for an automatic way to shift the formatting of the visualizations across devices. This is something that is currently a factor, but will only increase in complexity as other factors such as the data types and features of the devices change with time. It is interesting that many of these ideas currently exist and are being researched, and will need to be expanded upon to accomodate new technologies. Even with how fast everything feels to be moving in the realm of technology, as new tools are being integrated into the lives of people who use technology for work or personal reasons will gradually learn to use it like many have with technology we use today.
