#### Summary 
-  This is a review and summary of other papers in e-commerce. The paper used PRISMA in order  to find papers to include in their review.
####  Why Interesting 
-  PRISMA is an acronym which stands for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. I found this tool interesting on how it can be a quick way to scheme through the papers that might help me in deciding on choosing the type of papers to narrow down my research in terms of related works in any area of study a interested in
-  The paper has many tools that they used to also create visualization like:
