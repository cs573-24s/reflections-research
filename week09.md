The paper addresses the challenge of effectively visualizing high-dimensional datasets, which are common in various fields like digital libraries, bioinformatics, and simulations. The complexity of such datasets can lead to cluttered visualizations and difficulties in navigating the data space. To tackle this issue, the authors propose an interactive hierarchical approach called DOSFA (Dimension Ordering, Spacing, and Filtering Approach)
