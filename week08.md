This week I looked into the inspo folder and decided to read the paper "Yeah, This Graph Doesn't Show That: Analysis Of Online Engagement With Misleading Data Visualizations"

Misinformation has always been an issue, and it has become more significant since 2020. There has been a lot of controvesies surrounding that year's election along with the pandemic. The title of this article caught my attention as I am cruious as to how misleading a visualization could be. The authors of the paper tries to answer 2 questions, how long does misleading insights from a data visualization affect the poople that saw it and if people can identify misleading data insights in the text of their engagement. It is found that posts that adds some kind of insight or argument along side a visualization gets more interaction and more dicussions. One of the aspect that the paper brought up that I have never considered is how platforms filter/take care of data-driven misinformation. For example, Twitter/X added the feature where they have community notes under the post the helps with the pure spread of misinformation. Other social media have their own filtering system and such. A lot of the times however, when we are trying to argue or advocate for something online, people would believe you more if you have some kind of source backing your claim. This situation would involve data visualization sometimes, and can cause a big problem. Data can be presented to be misleading in certain ways and unforunately, this provides credibility to the person spreading misinformation if the other people on the paltform are not studying the visualization carefully. One term that I really liked in the paper was evidence theatre. You can potentailly find or make visualization that supports your argument. This would cause both side trying to one up the other side with more false information. The paper also points out at the end that the community on the platform does point out false information or biased visualization, and I agree. However, I do not believe that would be fully enough. I feel as though we have a responsibility when making data visulizations. Data does not always speaks for itself, so when making visualizations, we should always be mindful about the conclusion drawn from it. In terms of design, while making it cool or fun in some manner is a great idea, the goal should still be presenting unbiased result. This also rings the bell for data literacy and calling for more education towards data interpretation.
