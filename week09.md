The paper that I read this week was "State of the Art of Sports Data Visualization".
The paper focuese on how data visualization is currently being applied in sports.
The paper breaks down sports data into three groups; box score data, tracking data, and meta data.
Box score data consists of traditional data collected during the corse of a game.
For example, baseball box score data includes the score of each inning, hits, strikes, balls, etc.
Tracking data consists of compiling data collected using multi-camera tracking systems. 
Tracking data visualizations are relitvely new and offer the potential for "unprecedentedly detailed datasets".
Meta data consists of the information surrounding a sporting event.
For example, stadium capacities, player characteristics, kit colors, team badges, and even sponsor information.
Meta data can enhance box score and tracking data by making it easier to read and more visually pleasing.

Box score visualizations include season perfomance plots, shot timelines, and racer positioning (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... nth) over the course of a race.
Tracking visualizations include heat maps, shot selection maps, and player orientation figures.
Meta visualizations include player perfomance figures, team differentiation, and tournament brackets
